Choice Menu Chatbot is a text-based interactive application designed to facilitate various customer interactions, including order management, delivery inquiries, returns handling, providing feedback, and offering general information about products and services.

## Application Structure
The application is structured into multiple Python modules, each serving a specific function within the overall system. The key modules include:

- `main.py`: The entry point of the application, initiating the chatbot interface.
- `main_driver.py`: Contains the core logic for navigating through the main and submenus based on user input.
- `main_menu.py`: Manages the main menu of the application, offering users the initial set of options.
- Submenu Handlers:
  - `comenzi_menu.py`: Handles order-related queries and actions.
  - `livrare_menu.py`: Manages delivery-related inquiries.
  - `returnari_menu.py`: Deals with return requests and status checks.
  - `feedback_menu.py`: Collects user feedback on products and services.
  - `informatii_generale_menu.py`: Provides general information about the company and its offerings.
- `config.py`: Stores configuration settings, including directory paths for data storage.
- `credentials.py`: Contains sensitive credentials, such as Twilio API keys, for external services.
- `utilities.py`: Provides utility functions, such as `save_data_to_file`, used across various modules for data handling.

## Features
- **User Interaction**: Through a text-based menu system, users can navigate various services offered by the chatbot.
- **Data Handling**: User inputs and system-generated data are organized and stored efficiently, allowing for easy access and management.
- **Modular Design**: Each component of the application is contained within its own module, promoting modularity and ease of maintenance.
