**Spy.pet** is a website that **scrapes data from Discord**, allowing anyone to pay a as **low as 5 dollars** to look up a user's profile, see what servers they are in, view their messages, and more. It boasts over **300 million Discord users** in its database, which is still growing.

While the site claims to "prioritize your privacy" this is a **blatant lie**. Spy.pet is solely intended for **harassment and doxing**. Users can request **entire Discord servers** to get tracked, especially ones likely to have "interesting" conversations like **politics or LGBTQ+ spaces**. The owner is clearly motivated by hate, previously describing requests to track "private lgbtq Discord servers" before cleaning up that language when under scrutiny. Examples on the site were also manually edited to misgender a high profile user.

Legally, spy.pet is on **incredibly shaky ground**, likely **violating GDPR privacy laws around consent, data storage of minors, and the "right to be forgotten"*. The site's new "request removal" form seems to be merely for show.

On **April 19, 2024**, the popular YouTuber **No Text to Speech** published a video entitled _"Exposing the Website that Stalks You on Discord"_ about the spy.pet site. This launched a massive backlash against the site and its anonymous owner, later identified as going by "**unknownsrc**" with a history of transphobic behavior. No Text to Speech's video exposé connects the owner to the online handle "**unknownsrc**" through domains they control, accounts they are linked to, code repositories they contributed to, and other digital crumbs. **Unknownsrc** has a long history of transphobic and harassing behavior.

Its unknown if Discord is currently **pursuing legal action** against the individual behind spy.pet. However, with their identity and disturbing motives uncovered, it seems the site's days are numbered as as **multiple groups have taken the situation** into their hands to take down the site for good. What began as a way to **profit off violating privacy** has blown up into a wildfire of bad press that will be **hard to recover from**.

However, even before No Text to Speech published his video exposé, efforts to combat spy.pet were already secretly underway as a group calling themselves **The Shadow Team** was already working on a tool to help the community.
On **April 21st**, 2 days after **No Text to Speech** published their video, **Thor (PirateSoftware)** tweeted instructions for server owners to **detect and ban** the bots accounts spy.pet was using.

**The Shadow Team** had created [kickthespy.pet](https://kickthespy.pet), explaining it _"tries to find the discord scraper spy.pet's bot accounts in your server...via an API vulnerability...where we got all of their accounts in all servers."_ However, they warned this was just a "snapshot" as spy.pet could create new bots.

In parallel, another group called **The TaskForce** comprised of security researchers formed between **April 21-22** with the goal of taking down spy.pet completely. Over the next few days, they analyzed the Shadow Team's data, created new detection tools, and notified affected server owners. Their efforts paid off on **April 25th** when they discovered spy.pet was being hosted by **Hetzner cloud services** with its domain registered via **TLD Registrar Solutions**. Providing evidence of its illegal activities led both companies to **suspend the domain and terminate hosting**.

The spy.pet owner **lashed out**, falsely claiming on Telegram:
_"spy.pet has been suspended. I'll be setting up the backup domain. TL;DR: Never trust the Germans."_
hinting at the fact that his hosting provider was indeed **Hetzner**.

After sometime the owner of spy.pet said on Twitter:
_"Spy.pet was never at Hetzner and never will be. I have no idea whos VM you terminated..."_

With **another tweet** coming later, further obfuscating:
_"Spy.pet was suspended by 1Api, a company with which I personally have no relation, without any type of communication. As a domain holder, I have the right to own the domain and will do anything in my power to do so."_

<div align="center">

Despite **mounting evidence**, the owner continued making **denials and excuses** in the face of their **illegal operation** being shut down. However, the site began **going down globally** as the confirmed actions took effect.

The owner's defiance continued, saying on **April 27th**:
_"I've completely recoded the mutual guild checker...I'll fill the site with ~5k servers before I make it public again."_

<div align="center">

</div>

By this point, **The TaskForce** had already tracked down a potential **new domain called spying.pet** that the owner seemed to be preparing to use. With the **spy.pet domain terminated**, they were closely monitoring for any resurfacing of the invasive service under a new web address. The owner's remarks made it clear **this was not the end** of their efforts to illegally scrape Discord users data and communications.

On **April 28th**, The owner of spy.pet had set the site again under the new domain called **spying.pet** confirming The TaskForce's research while also stating plans to re-infiltrate servers:
_"With Discord fixing joining servers, I've had to rely on pre-filled accounts...I'll be joining the remaining 12K servers when Discord gets knocked down, so that I can get back again."_

This escalating battle shows groups steadfastly defending user privacy on Discord against spy.pet's invasive efforts to **profit off data through harassment and hate**. While the site is currently down, the fight appears far from over as the owner vows to resurrect the scraping operation by any means necessary.

Both **The Shadow Team** and **The TaskForce** have made it clear they will continue monitoring for spy.pet's return, whether on a new domain or by creating new bot accounts. With No Text to Speech's video exposé also bringing widespread scrutiny, the anonymous owner of this unethical service faces an uphill battle to regain a foothold.
